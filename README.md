This is a Spotify Clone using React and the Spotify API.

The Goal of this project is primarily to work on improving my React and API skills by attempting to replicate the Spotify front end while allowing for the same functionality by using Spotify's API.

With this Project, I intend to explore React Hooks, because in the past, I primarily used class-based components. While class-based components are easy to read and work with, after doing some research, I am pretty sure that Hooks are the general way that components will be built and structured going forward.

I wanted this project to be as close to vanilla React as possible, so I only used a few external libraries for certain visual elements like icons.
